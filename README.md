# Navi

*Hey, listen!*

Adds listeners for `Activity` and `Fragment`.

## Deprecated

The navi library is deprecated in favor of [lifecycle-aware components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle). No more development will be taking place.

## Why?

In a word: **composition**.

**For applications**, you currently have to tie a lot of your functionality directly to each `Activity` and `Fragment`. The potential for code reuse is low. Testing is difficult.

**For libraries**, if you want to interact with the `Activity` or `Fragment` at all, good luck. You either have to leave brittle instructions on how to properly implement the library, or you provide your own `Activity`/`Fragment`. Two libraries providing their own components are difficult (or impossible) to use together.

With Navi, you can avoid all these problems. Applications can decouple your code from the underlying `Activity` or `Fragment`. Libraries using Navi can write real plugins instead of brittle/coupled solutions.

## Usage

The `NaviComponent` interface is the basis for everything; you can add/remove listeners for
any specific callbacks that exist on `Activity` and `Fragment`:

```java
naviComponent.addListener(Event.CREATE, new Listener<Bundle>() {
  @Override public void call(Bundle bundle) {
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
  }
});
```

You will either need to implement the `NaviComponent` interface yourself, or if you're able, you
can save time by using one of the default implementations provided (in the form of `NaviActivity`,
`NaviAppCompatActivity`, `NaviFragment` and `NaviDialogFragment`). This flexibility allows you to
integrate Navi even if you're already being forced to use a different base `Activity` or `Fragment`.

Since RxJava is the bees knees, it also provides Rx bindings for all listeners via `RxNavi`. Simply pass your `NaviComponent` to them and it'll do the
rest. For example, you could use it to set the content view instead of overriding `onCreate()`:

```java
RxNavi.observe(naviComponent, Event.CREATE)
    .subscribe(bundle -> setContentView(R.layout.main));
```

## Installation
